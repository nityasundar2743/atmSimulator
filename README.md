# atmSimulator
The "atmSimulator" is a comprehensive and user-friendly ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation system designed to replicate the functionalities and operations of a real-world ATM. This repository provides a virtual environment where users can experience a realistic ATM-like interface and interact with various banking operations.

Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface: The ATM simulator offers an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface, resembling a physical ATM, allowing users to perform banking transactions effortlessly.

Transaction Capabilities: Users can perform a wide range of banking operations, including cash withdrawals, cash deposit and balance inquiries and account management. These functionalities simulate the operations available in a typical ATM, providing a realistic banking experience.

Simulated PIN Authentication: The simulator incorporates Account Number and PIN authentication system, allowing users to forget the hassle of carrying card and the personal identification number (PIN) ensures that no malicious user gets access.

Account Management: Users can create and manage multiple virtual bank accounts within the simulator, enabling them to simulate transactions in different accounts, check balances, and track transaction histories.

Error Handling and Notifications: The simulator is equipped with error handling mechanisms to simulate real-life scenarios, such as insufficient funds, invalid PIN, and Invalid credentials. Users will receive appropriate notifications and prompts to replicate the feedback provided by an actual ATM.

Real-Time Feedback: The simulator offers real-time feedback on transaction status, ensuring users are promptly informed about successful or failed transactions, providing a realistic user experience.
